DayZ Chernarus - FlagStore near Radio Zenit.
I had this idea for a flagstore and I thought that I should place it near Radio Zenit.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:
1: Four of each flags, there are 30 of them in the game so that makes it a total of 120 flags in the store.
2: Four starter kits for the flags with tools and materials.
3: The Tools are following: 4 Flag Pole kits, 4 Sledgehammers, 4 Shovels, 4 Hatchets and 4 Hammers. So one each for every kit.
4: Materials for the Flag pole are following: 4 Ropes, 4 Metal Wires, 4 Boxes of Nails, 4 piles of Wooden Logs with 10 logs each
and 4 piles of Large Stones with 32 stones each.
5: 1 Land_Village_store.
6: 1 Land_Tisy_RadarPlatform_Top.
7: 3 StaticObj_Tisy_RadarPlatform_Mid.
8: Bonfire 5x

So, easiest way to find this is if you go from Ropka to Radio Zenit by following the road.
And if it dark when you get there, you will be able to see it thanks to the bonfires that are there.
3 bonfires are on the platform, 2 is at the back of the store and 1 is close to the ramp on the left side.
2 bonfires are at the end of the ramp guiding players to the way up to the store.
2 flag types are on the counter while the others are on the shelves.
The Wooden Logs and the Large Stones are outside the store on the right side of the ramp, you can´t miss them.
The other materials, flag pole kit and the tools are inside the store on the shelves behind the counter with the cash register on it.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/FlagStore.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/FlagStore.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
